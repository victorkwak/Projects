Projects
========

This repo contains some code that I've been working on for personal learning and curiosity. 

DailyProgrammer contains problems posted to reddit's subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer.

FindBriefcase is a class project - a game where you are a character (a ninja) that has snuck into a building to steal the briefcase with the secret information, an item which is hidden in one of nine rooms.

Fibonacci contains a Fibonacci number generator. It features a GUI and generates numbers fairly quickly using a closed form solution of the usual Fibonacci recursive relation.

HostsGrabber features a GUI and grabs ad-server lists from mutliple sources and compiles the lists into one, removing duplicate entries while maintaining the original authors' comments. Altering one's hosts file is a great alternative to using ad-blocking extensions, as ad-blocking extensions use additional system resources while the hosts file method does not have any overhead. The program only generates a hosts file, and the user must manually apply this file, and this process is not automated.
