Projects
========

This repo contains some code that I've been working on for personal learning and curiosity as well as school projects
required by the school.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/DailyProgrammer">DailyProgrammer</a>**
contains problems posted to reddit's subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/Fibonacci/src">Fibonacci</a>** is a Fibonacci
number generator. It features a GUI and generates numbers fairly quickly using a closed form solution of the usual
Fibonacci recursive relation.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/HostsGrabber/src">HostsGrabber**</a> features
a GUI and grabs ad-server lists from multiple sources and compiles the lists into one, removing duplicate entries while
maintaining the original authors' comments. Altering one's hosts file is a great alternative to using ad-blocking
extensions, as ad-blocking extensions can use a lot of additional system resources while the hosts file method
uses minimal resources. The program only applies the file automatically to the system in OS X and Unix systems
only at the moment.

*In progress* - **<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/NHLScraper/src">NHLScraper</a>**
was inspired by an extra credit assignment in the Microeconomics class. The professor needed data for a research paper
and asked the class to copy-paste data of specific players he provides onto Excel files. This process seemed to me to
be highly prone to error, and so I thought I would try and make a program that would essentially do 200~ish man hours
of work in a few seconds with less error.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/School/FindBriefcase/src">FindBriefcase</a>** is a class
group project - a game where you are a character (a ninja) that has sneaked into a building to steal the briefcase with
the secret information, an item which is hidden in one of nine rooms.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/School/NotePad/src">NotePad</a>** is an attempt at
replicating Microsoft's NotePad that comes with Windows.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/School/Data%20Structures">Data Structures</a>**
contains data structure implementations.
