Projects
========

This repo contains some code that I've been working on for personal learning and curiosity as well as school projects required by the school.

Personal
--------

DailyProgrammer contains problems posted to reddit's subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer.

Fibonacci contains a Fibonacci number generator. It features a GUI and generates numbers fairly quickly using a closed form solution of the usual Fibonacci recursive relation.

HostsGrabber features a GUI and grabs ad-server lists from multiple sources and compiles the lists into one, removing duplicate entries while maintaining the original authors' comments. Altering one's hosts file is a great alternative to using ad-blocking extensions, as ad-blocking extensions use additional system resources while the hosts file method does not have any overhead. The program only applies the file automatically to the system in OS X systems only.

In progress - NHLScraper was inspired by an extra credit assignment in the Microeconomics class. The professor needed data for a research paper and asked the class to copy-paste data of specific players he provides onto Excel files. This process seemed to me to be highly prone to error, and so I thought I would try and make a program that would essentially do 200~ish man hours of work in a few seconds with less error. 

School
------

FindBriefcase is a class project - a game where you are a character (a ninja) that has sneaked into a building to steal the briefcase with the secret information, an item which is hidden in one of nine rooms.

NotePad is an attempt at replicating Microsoft's NotePad that comes with Windows. 

Hashing, Set, and Stack are data structure implementations.
