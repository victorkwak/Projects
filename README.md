Projects
========

This repo contains some code that I've been working on for personal learning and curiosity as well as school projects required by the school.

**DailyProgrammer** contains problems posted to reddit's subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer.

**Fibonacci** is a Fibonacci number generator. It features a GUI and generates numbers fairly quickly using a closed form solution of the usual Fibonacci recursive relation.

**HostsGrabber** features a GUI and grabs ad-server lists from multiple sources and compiles the lists into one, removing duplicate entries while maintaining the original authors' comments. Altering one's hosts file is a great alternative to using ad-blocking extensions, as ad-blocking extensions can use a lot of additional system resources while the hosts file method uses minimal resources. The program only applies the file automatically to the system in OS X and Unix systems only at the moment.

*In progress* - **NHLScraper** was inspired by an extra credit assignment in the Microeconomics class. The professor needed data for a research paper and asked the class to copy-paste data of specific players he provides onto Excel files. This process seemed to me to be highly prone to error, and so I thought I would try and make a program that would essentially do 200~ish man hours of work in a few seconds with less error.

**FindBriefcase** is a class project - a game where you are a character (a ninja) that has sneaked into a building to steal the briefcase with the secret information, an item which is hidden in one of nine rooms.

**NotePad** is an attempt at replicating Microsoft's NotePad that comes with Windows. 

**Hashing**, **Set**, and **Stack** are data structure implementations.
