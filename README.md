Projects
========

This repo contains some code that I've been working on for personal learning and curiosity as well as school projects
required by the school.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/HostsGrabber">HostsGrabber**</a>
is an efficient Internet ad-blocking implementation with minimal overhead. It pulls and compiles several hosts files
from the Internet as well as lists used by Ad-Block Plus to supplement those hosts files. The program automates the
process of locating up-to-date and reputable hosts files for use with ad-blocking, as well as implementing the files
into your system.
Currently, the program only supports the Mac and Linux platforms.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/Fibonacci/src">Fibonacci</a>** is a Fibonacci
number generator. It features a GUI and generates numbers quickly using a fast doubling recursive method.

contains problems posted to reddit's subreddit /r/dailyprogrammer.

*In progress* - **<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/Personal/NHLScraper/src">NHLScraper</a>**
was inspired by an extra credit assignment in the Microeconomics class. The professor needed data for a research paper
and asked the class to copy-paste data of specific players he provides onto Excel files. This process seemed to me to
be highly prone to error, and so I thought I would try and make a program that would essentially do 200~ish man hours
of work in a few seconds with less error.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/School/FindBriefcase/src">FindBriefcase</a>** is a class
group project - a game where you are a character (a ninja) that has sneaked into a building to steal the briefcase with
the secret information, an item which is hidden in one of nine rooms.

**<a href="https://github.com/victorkwak/Projects/tree/master/School/NotePad/src">NotePad</a>** is an attempt at
replicating Microsoft's NotePad that comes with Windows.
